# Machlina

An open source linear models (and maybe more) library that analyzes the results for you.

# Roadmap

1. Ordinary Least Squares with non-singular features
2. Added variable analysis
3. Partial residual analysis
4. Minimum sum of squares unbiased estimator when the matrix is singular
5. Mixed Effects / Weighed Least Squares
6. Ridge and Lasso Regression
7. Model selection tools and built in sub model bias-variance tradeoff analysis via AIC, BIC
8. ???

### NOTE:

The project is in its infancy. Currently it inefficiently computes the OLS estimate of a linear model, with support for added variable analysis. The documentation will grow in tandem with the completion of each major item.
